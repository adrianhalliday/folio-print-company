# Past Work: Print Company
Custom Vue2/Nuxt headless front-end for a large format print company website, completed in 2021. The company is no longer trading so I have created a small amount of default hard-coded content to enable the site to function as a portfolio piece without the CMS.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
